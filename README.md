# Dholuo-Swahili-Neural-Machine-Translator
Machine Translation (MT) has seen significant advancements, particularly with the rise of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), which leverages neural networks to produce more fluent and contextually accurate translations. This research aimed to develop a specialized NMT model to translate texts from Dholuo to Swahili. The model was implemented using the OpenNMT-py toolkit, a powerful and flexible open-source framework for neural machine translation.It utilized the Kencorpus dataset, which contains texts in both Dholuo and Swahili. This dataset underwent rigorous cleaning processes to remove noise and inconsistencies, ensuring that the data used for training the model was of high quality.The developed NMT model was evaluated using the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, a standard metric for assessing translation quality. The model achieved a BLEU score of 8.72, indicating a moderate level of translation accuracy. This score reflects the model's ability to generate translations that are reasonably close to human reference translations, though further refinements are necessary to enhance performance.This research demonstrates the potential of neural machine translation in handling less-resourced language pairs and highlights the importance of data preparation and model evaluation in developing effective translation systems.
